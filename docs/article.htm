<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    I worked for a cloud storage .com back in the 2000's,
    when clouds were just in the sky or on whiteboards.
    We called it online file storage.
    You'd upload your files, then you could access them anywhere...
    and send them to your friends.
    It wasn't file sharing like Napster / Gnutella / Limewire;
    you weren't sharing your CD collection with the whole world.
    But you could send your CD collection to your sister.
    So this was "fair use" and we stayed below the radar.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of tech has evolved and emerged since then, 
    and you can make the argument that there's no justification for file sharing, or sending,
    because there is a bustling marketplace for buying and renting access to files online.
    Pay your monthly fee for access to a file castle,
    and send whatever you want to somebody else paying a monthly fee to the same castle.
    All legit, all above-board.
    Something like Napster will never (be allowed to) exist again.
</p>
<p>
    So what's this msgfiles business all about then?
    Well, what if what you want to send is not in one of these file castles?
    What if you've just created something new, and want to send it to a friend?
    There are services for sending attachments of any size.
    You could ZIP a large directory of files and send that as a large attachment,
    a CD collection to your sister even.
</p>
<p>
    And we're back to cloud computing.
</p>
<p>
    msgfiles is not that.
    It is all about locality, and simplicity.
    Your home, your work, your dorm.
